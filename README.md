# 🌦️ **Seasonal Affective Disorder: A Data Analysis**
### **GitHub Pages:** https://aanderson234.github.io/B172262/  

## 📖 **Overview**
This report examines the impact of **Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)** on antidepressant prescription trends, particularly **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**, in Scotland. Using data from **2022–2023**, it explores correlations between regional sunlight exposure and prescription patterns to uncover insights into seasonal mental health challenges.

Key highlights include:
- Temporal trends in SSRI prescriptions.
- Regional disparities in sunlight exposure and treatment patterns.
- Recommendations for policy interventions to address SAD-related health disparities.

## 📊 **Key Findings**
### **1. Temporal Trends**
- **Prescription Peaks**: March, August, and November show notable increases in SSRI prescriptions.
- **Seasonal Effects**: A lag in treatment-seeking behavior aligns with reduced winter sunlight.
  
### **2. Regional Disparities**
- **High Per-Capita Prescriptions**: Northern regions like Orkney and Shetland show disproportionate prescription rates due to extreme seasonal light fluctuations.
- **Urban Centers**: Glasgow reports the highest total prescriptions, reflecting population density and healthcare access.
